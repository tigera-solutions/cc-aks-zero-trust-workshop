# Microsoft Azure: Hands-on AKS workshop </br> Implementing zero-trust security for containers

## Welcome

In this AKS-focused workshop, you will work with Microsoft Azure and Calico Cloud to learn how implement zero-trust security for workloads to reduce the attack surface of applications running on AKS.  

Cloud-native applications require a modern approach based on the zero-trust principles of identity-based access, least privilege access, and proactively detecting threats and reducing the blast radius in case of a breach.

Calico Cloud enables fine-grained, zero-trust workload access controls between your microservices and external databases, cloud services, APIs, and other applications. It also prevents the lateral movement of threats with identity-aware segmentation that works across all of your workload environments, including hosts, VMs, Kubernetes components, and services.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications in Microsoft Azure, along with best practices that you can implement in your organization.

### Time Requirements

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 60-90 minutes.

### Target Audience

- Cloud Professionals
- DevSecOps Professional
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Solutions Architects
- Anyone interested in Calico Cloud :)

### Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to deploy zero-trust workload access controls
2. Extend firewall protection at the granular, workload level
3. Block lateral movement of APTs with identity-aware microsegmentation
4. Understand how to apply zero-trust security controls at application level.
