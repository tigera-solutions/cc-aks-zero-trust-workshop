# Module 3 - Connect your cluster to Calico Cloud

> **Note**: In order to complete this module, you will need to a [Calico Cloud account](https://www.calicocloud.io/). If you are participating in a live workshop, you will receive an invite with the information for connecting to an active Calico Cloud environment and join your AKS cluster in there.

If you are running this workshop in a self-paced mode, you can create an Calico Cloud environment following the steps [here](modules/).  

Issues with being unable to navigate menus in the UI are often due to browsers blocking scripts - please ensure that you disabled all blocker scripts.




## Step 2 - Connecting your cluster to Calico Cloud.

1. When returning to the [Calico Cloud](https://www.calicocloud.io/) website, use the "Login as an Existing User" link, enter your e-mail and password to log back into your trial environment. The welcome screen will allow you to choose among four use cases and will provide a guided tour for each use case. After that you can proceed to connect your first cluster. This option directs you to the **Managed Clusters** section. Click on the "**Connect Cluster**" button to start the process.

2. The Connect Cluster window will allow you to choose a name to identify your cluster in Calico Cloud and select which platform you are running the cluster on. The next window presents a link for you to review the cluster requirements for Calico Cloud. A kubectl command to run the installation script will be generated, you need to copy and apply this command in your cluster.

3. Run the installation script in your cluster. Script should look similar to this:
    
    <pre>
    kubectl apply -f https://installer.calicocloud.io/manifests/cc-operator/lat
    est/deploy.yaml && curl -H "Authorization: Bearer a7c2oex34:00llxrhcq:1ga2c
    z69d7ug81yjgakpyclv6o3eu8o97kp7t2483lmwajslu47xed94e4ic8ywn" "https://www.c
    alicocloud.io/api/managed-cluster/deploy.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
    </pre>

    > Output should look similar to:
    <pre>

    Joining the cluster to Calico Cloud can take a few minutes. Meanwhile the Calico resources can be monitored until they are all reporting `Available` as `True`

    ```bash
    kubectl get tigerastatus                                                                                                                    

    NAME                            AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
    apiserver                       True        False         False      96s
    calico                          True        False         False      16s
    compliance                      True        False         False      21s
    intrusion-detection             True        False         False      41s
    log-collector                   True        False         False      21s
    management-cluster-connection   True        False         False      51s
    monitor                         True        False         False      2m1s
    ```

    You can also monitor your cluster installation on the Calico Cloud UI. Go to the "**Managed Clusters**" section, select your cluster and expand the timestamp dropdown to see the installation logs.
    In a few minutes the status will change from **Installing** to **Done**. Congratulations! You successfully connected your cluster to Calico Cloud.

## STEP 3 - Selecting your cluster.

Once the installation is completed, you will be able to start interacting with your cluster from the Calico Cloud interface. Calico Cloud provides a single pane of glass for managing multiple clusters. If you followed the previous steps, you would have two clusters connected to Calico Cloud at this point: Your cluster and a pre-configured lab cluster that allows you to explore some of the features in Calico Cloud.

You can switch between clusters by following the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard section - the first icon under the Calico Cat on the top-left of the UI.

2. Click on the **Cluster** dropdown button on the top-right of the UI.

3. Select your recently added cluster.

The "**Cluster**" dropdown button will be always visible accross the Calico Cloud UI, no matter which section you are viewing. You can change the cluster you want to interact with at any moment. 
When you change the cluster, the whole Calico Cloud context will change immediatelly to reflect the information regarding the current selected cluster.
