# Module 2 - Zero-Trust Workload Access Control with Namespace Isolation Recommendation

One of the best ways to make your Kubernetes cluster more secure is to use network policy to isolate namespaces. This means that you only allow the communication between namespaces that is absolutely necessary, and you block everything else. This helps to reduce the risk of an attacker moving from one part of your cluster to another if they manage to get in.

Calico Cloud makes it simple for platform operators to set up namespace isolation. You don't need to be an expert in writing network policies or know the details of how your applications communicate. Calico Cloud looks at the flow logs generated by your workloads. Then, it automatically suggests and sets up policies for each namespace. These policies can be used to isolate your namespaces from each other.

In this module, we will learn how to use Calico to recommend and set up network policies to control access to and from a namespace. We will install the `Cat Facts Application`. Once the application is deployed, we will enable the policy recommandations and then review and activate the policies.

1. Clone this repository in your Azure Cloud Shell.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tigera-solutions/cc-aks-zero-trust-workshop.git && \
   cd cc-aks-zero-trust-workshop
   ```

1. Install the example application stacks:

   From the cloned directory, execute:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f pre
   ```

Included in the `pre` folder, there is an application that will be used in the exercises during the workshop. The diagram below shows how the elements of this application communicate between themselves.

There are also other objects that will be created. We will learn about them later in the workshop.

## Service Graph

Connect to Calico Cloud GUI. From the menu, select `Service Graph > Default`. Explore the options.

## The Zero Trust approach

A global default deny policy ensures that unwanted traffic (ingress and egress) is denied by default. Pods without policy (or incorrect policy) are not allowed traffic until the appropriate network policy is defined. Although the staging policy tool will help you find the incorrect or the missing policy, a global deny policy helps mitigate other lateral malicious attacks.

By default, all traffic is allowed between the pods in a cluster. Let's start by testing connectivity between application components and across application stacks. All of these tests should succeed as there are no policies in place.

We recommend creating a global default deny policy after you complete reviewing the policy for the traffic you want to allow. Use the stage policy feature to get your allowed traffic working as expected, then lock down the cluster to block unwanted traffic.

## Enable policy recommendations

1. In the left navbar in Manager UI, click **Policies, Recommendations**.
2. On the opt-in page, click Enable Policy Recommendations.

   The Policy Recommendations board is automatically displayed.

> [!NOTE]  
> - A policy recommendation is generated for every namespace in your cluster (unless namespaces are filtered out by an Admin using the selector in the PolicyRecommendationScope resource).
> - Flow logs are continuously monitored for policy recommendations.
> - Recommended policies are continuously updated until you Add to policy board or Dismiss policy using the Actions menu.
> - Policy recommendations are created as staged network policies so you can safely observe the traffic before enforcing them.
> - Traffic originating from the recommended policy's namespace is used to generate egress rules, and traffic destined for the namespace is used to define ingress rules.
> - To stop policy recommendations from being processed and updated for a namespace, click the Action menu, Dismiss policy.

3. Review the policy recommendations
   
   After a few minuties, you will be able to see the policy recommendation. Take a minute to review the rules being suggested and ensure they align with your intentions.

4. Activate policy recommendations
  
   From the Policy Recommendation board, select a policy recommendation (or bulk select) and select, `Add to policy board`. You can now view the active policies in the Policies Board. In the left navbar, click `Policies`.

   ![policy-recommendation](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/cc-aks-zero-trust-workshop/assets/104035488/088112b2-ea72-4e8b-bc72-769e855a8828)

5. View the active policies in Policy Recommendations.

   Click on the `Active` tab in `Policy Recommendations`. Active policies were recommendations that were moved to the policy board.

   ![active-policies](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/cc-aks-zero-trust-workshop/assets/104035488/11782de7-a26a-4d3e-9e24-a800b77592d1)

   Policy recommendations are added to the namespace-isolation tier. Note the following:

   - Staged network policy recommendations work like any other staged network policy.
   - You cannot move recommended staged policies in the namespace-isolation tier.
   - The name of the namespace-isolation tier is fixed and cannot be changed

   You are now ready to observe traffic flows in Policies board to verify that the policy is authorizing traffic as expected. When a policy works as expected, you can safely enforce it.
